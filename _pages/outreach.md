### High School, Under-Graduate, Graduate and Post-Doc Summer Internship Program.

I was part of the summer internship-mentoring program organized by NCGR for several years. Upto 20 students spend two weeks in classroom environment followed by six weeks of self-directed bioinformatics research, working with their own data if possible. This effort is funded by the Gordon Betty Moore Foundation Marine Micro-Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project, the New Mexico INBRE Sequencing and Bioinformatics core and by other individual research grants.

### 2007 MAP Fellow.

As a Montana Apprenticeship Program (MAP) fellow, I worked with diverse highly motivated students that possess strong interest in science and math over a period of six weeks in summer of 2007 to provide pre-college experience including hands on research in a science and/or engineering laboratory.
