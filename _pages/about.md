I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Computing, DePaul University, Chicago, USA. My research focus is mainly on Computational Biology and applied bioinformatics. Before joining DePaul University, I was a Bioinformatics Research Scientist at the National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR), Santa Fe, NM from 2010 â€“ 2019 where my primary focus was on developing computational workflows for high-throughput DNA/RNA sequence data analysis. I collaborate with Biologists, Biochemists across several Universities and research institutions. My research work is primarily funded by the National Science Foundation.
